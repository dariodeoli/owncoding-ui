# Accessibility interaction contracts

OwnCoding UI targets WCAG 2.1 AA. These contracts are part of the public component behavior and should not be removed by consuming applications.

## Comboboxes

`useComboboxNavigation` is the shared headless behavior used by the bank, city, email, product, and device fields.

- Focus remains on the input.
- The input exposes `role="combobox"`, `aria-controls`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-autocomplete="list"`, and `aria-activedescendant`.
- Arrow Up/Down wraps through options; Home/End jumps to the bounds; Enter selects; Escape closes.
- Options use stable IDs and must not contain nested links or buttons.
- Pointer selection prevents the input from losing focus before selection.

Consumers building a compatible field can use the returned `inputProps`, `listboxProps`, and `getOptionProps(index)` objects. When composing custom handlers, run the application handler first and skip the shared handler when `event.defaultPrevented` is true.

## Menus and popovers

`MenuDesplegable` follows the ARIA menu pattern: one roving Tab stop, Arrow Up/Down, Home/End, Escape, and focus restoration to the trigger. Separators use `role="separator"`.

`portal={true}` is additive: the popup uses a real React portal under `document.body`,
independent of the Popover API, so overflow/transform ancestors do not clip it.
The viewport determines flipping/clamping; scroll and resize reposition it, and
an anchor outside the visible viewport/scroll region closes it. In this mode
`ariaLabel` also names the trigger (use the visible label or a meaningful icon
name). Tab/Shift+Tab close the menu and continue beside its trigger. Escape closes
only the menu; an action opening another dialog keeps that dialog's focus.

`dialogFocusContains(container, target)` and
`dialogFocusableElements(container, selector?)` are exported from the root and
`core` entrypoints. A custom dialog uses them instead of copying portal ownership
logic. Only connected library portals anchored in that container count; a fake
`data-oc-menu-portal` attribute or a menu from another dialog does not. The helper
returns DOM order with portal controls inserted after their anchor, preserving a
single roving menu stop by default. A custom selector can preserve summary,
contenteditable or positive tabindex controls; its caller retains its own order
policy. Closing/unmounting unregisters the scope. The canonical dialog hook already
uses these helpers and respects `defaultPrevented` from child controls.

`CampanaAvisos` is a non-modal dialog rather than a menu because its content can mix links, buttons, empty states, and footer actions. It moves focus into the panel, closes with Escape, and returns focus to its trigger. The trigger's accessible name includes the unread count.

## Tabs

`Subtabs` and `NavegacionSeccion` have one Tab stop and support Arrow Left/Right plus Home/End. `NavegacionSeccion` connects the active tab to its rendered `tabpanel`.

## Validation and feedback

`FormField` merges its hint/error ID with an existing `aria-describedby` value and applies `aria-invalid` to the matching form control. Keep `htmlFor` equal to the control ID.

Error toasts are persistent and assertive by default. Success and informational toasts default to four seconds and pause while hovered or focused:

```js
const toast = useToast()
toast.success('Saved', 'The changes are live.', { duration: 6000 })
toast.error('Could not save', 'Try again.')
toast.error('Temporary issue', undefined, { persistent: false, duration: 8000 })
```

## Motion and touch

Import `owncoding-ui/base.css` for the global `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback. Primary touch controls and icon actions expose at least a 44 by 44 CSS pixel target, either through `min-h-11`/`h-11 w-11` or the `toque-44` helper.

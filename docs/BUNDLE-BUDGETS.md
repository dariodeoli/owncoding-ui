# Original financial assets and bounded package budgets

Baseline update: **2026-10-02**, package **0.62.0**. The CI failure was a real
size-budget failure, not merely a build warning. The initial verification omitted
`npm run check:bundle`; this command is required after `npm run build` from now on.
The failed CI run must not be considered resolved until a new commit passes CI.

## Measured cause

This patch preserves the supplied GNB and San Cristóbal originals unchanged:
371,842 B + 123,530 B = **495,372 B** of PNG data. Their manifest hashes and source
bytes do not change. The existing build embeds them as base64 in both the root and
financial bundles, adding **660,500 B** of base64 payload to each bundle.

Removing only those payload strings in memory (not editing source/assets) measures
496,593 B of incremental gzip in the root and 494,827 B in financial. The complete
comparison against upstream `4cdff62555a29fbd7d08ffd42b3927803d63bedc` is:

| Artifact | Upstream raw / gzip B | With originals raw / gzip B |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `dist/index.js` | 1,884,587 / 968,388 | 2,545,371 / 1,465,049 |
| `dist/financial.js` | 1,306,835 / 835,526 | 1,967,619 / 1,330,428 |

The small difference from the payload-only measurement includes financial metadata,
registry wiring and the curated bank-list change. The upstream archive's
`npm pack --dry-run --json --ignore-scripts` measures 3,658,023 B packed and
7,987,053 B unpacked; the expanded package, before this budget note, measures
5,140,048 B packed and 9,810,090 B unpacked. Source PNGs, inline bundles, maps and
the associated docs explain why package growth exceeds a single copy of each PNG.
Package measurements are rechecked after this note and its tests are added.

## Only affected ceilings change

| Guard | Previous B | New B |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Root raw | 2,100,000 | 2,600,000 |
| Root gzip | 1,120,000 | 1,500,000 |
| Financial raw | 1,520,000 | 2,010,000 |
| Financial gzip | 990,000 | 1,360,000 |
| Package packed | 5,100,000 | 5,250,000 |
| Package unpacked | 9,800,000 | 10,010,000 |

These finite ceilings leave approximately 2% over the measured new baseline,
rounded for bounded tolerance; they do not preserve the old package's much larger
unused margin. Utilities, IA, phone, financial metadata, app identity and email
budgets are unchanged. Numbered-copy exclusion and all failure checks remain active.

## Architecture tradeoff

The root import still carries inline financial artwork. Consumers needing no images
should prefer the byte-free financial-metadata or utils entry points. Externalizing
assets would require separate public packaging/runtime-contract work; this patch
does not change that contract or optimize, crop, recompress or redraw originals.
The documented project-surface authorization is not an unlimited/open license.

## Required proof

Run `npm run gallery:check`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, **`npm run check:bundle`**,
`npm run test:types`, `npm run test:package`, `npm run gallery:build`,
`npm run readme:check`, `npm run financial-assets:check`, and `git diff --check`.

## Accepted ADR: shared synchronous visual ESM graph (2026-10-02)

Approved scope: root + financial in one esbuild multi-entry splitting build,
with data URL loaders and `"use client"` on both entries and their shared chunks.
Utils, metadata, IA, phone, identity and email retain separate builds. Emitted
file URLs or async asset APIs were rejected: they would change the raw Node SSR
contract. Recompression/cropping originals was rejected. Package includes chunks,
maps and original asset files; no package guard excludes those bytes.

The closure guard parses imports with es-module-lexer, sums unique reachable
in-dist JS (cycles/shared nodes once), sums gzip per file rather than a combined
stream, and rejects missing files, path/symlink escapes, ambiguous/encoded paths,
nonliteral imports and undeclared externals. Pure closures reject client modules,
React dependencies and data-image payloads. Pack smoke imports the actual tarball,
SSR-renders data-URL logos in raw Node, traverses its closure and checks all
shipped original hashes. Negative tests cover these boundaries.

### Three measured stages

Published baseline: `8607ac6`, unchanged 74 assets. Shared architecture measurement
was taken **before** adding assets or metadata; package figures below are the
observed snapshots before this expanded documentation (final figures are reported
by the required check). This is physical packaging deduplication, **not** reduced
traffic/cost of loading a financial/root closure.

| Guard | Published raw / gzip B | Shared, no additions | Shared + eligible originals |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Root reachable closure | 2,587,421 / 1,491,404 | 2,589,576 / 1,491,223 | 3,197,592 / 1,941,745 |
| Financial reachable closure | 2,006,529 / 1,356,434 | 2,008,581 / 1,357,019 | 2,616,597 / 1,807,543 |
| Utils pure closure | 163,119 / 39,718 | 163,119 / 39,718 | 165,395 / 40,147 |
| Financial metadata pure closure | 40,093 / 7,511 | 40,093 / 7,511 | 42,369 / 7,950 |
| Package packed / unpacked | 5,226,791 / 9,952,341 | 3,857,890 / 7,861,564 | 4,760,628 / 8,952,028 |

Ten unmodified originals add **453,383 B** source bytes. Root/financial closure
raw delta is 608,016 B each versus the shared stage, including metadata/wiring.
Gzip deltas are 450,522 B root and 450,524 B financial. Utils/metadata raw growth
is exactly 2,276 B of canonical byte-free institution/payment metadata; gzip
increases 429/439 B. Both retain the transitive purity guard.

The new public Visa PNG + Mastercard SVG are 7,156 + 2,543 = 9,699 B original.
Their two emitted asset modules contribute 12,628 raw B and 7,402 incremental
gzip B to the shared chunk, measured by removing only those two module blocks
in memory (not rewriting originals). This payload-only measurement excludes
metadata/wiring changes and is not a separate whole-package baseline.

A complete San Lorenzo horizontal-original trial measured 5,480,592 B packed,
exceeding the unchanged 5,250,000 B total cap by 230,592 B. That file is not
packaged; its genuine compact is used with explicit horizontal containment.

### Finite rebaseline, only attributable closures

| Guard | Previous cap raw / gzip B | New cap raw / gzip B |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Root | 2,600,000 / 1,500,000 | 3,262,000 / 1,981,000 |
| Financial | 2,010,000 / 1,360,000 | 2,669,000 / 1,844,000 |
| Utils | 165,000 / 42,000 | 168,702 / 40,949 |
| Financial metadata | 42,000 / 9,000 | 43,216 / 8,109 |

Visual caps round approximately 2% over actual reachable cost. Pure metadata
caps use floor(actual × 1.02), no more than 2% headroom; the unrelated pure entry
caps are unchanged. Package caps remain **5,250,000 packed / 10,010,000 unpacked**.
The two pure gzip ceilings decrease rather than preserving unnecessary margin.
Source permission remains project-surface authorization, not an open license.

### Consequences and rollback

Loading either visual closure still carries the inline artwork; importing both
in one ESM graph shares the physical module. Chunk names are internal and may
change per build. Consumers/tarballs must preserve all emitted relative chunks.
Rollback the multi-entry build, closure guard/tests and this new asset/metadata
batch together; keep previously published gallery fixtures and original assets.
Before final proof, regenerate dist; after source freeze use check-only commands.

## Whitespace-only build funding (2026-10-03)

The shared esbuild options enable only `minifyWhitespace`. Identifier and syntax
minification remain explicitly disabled; no property mangling, export removal,
asset conversion, dependency change or ceiling increase is involved. Source maps
and client banners remain linked. Source remains readable; generated JavaScript
is compact and its regeneration creates a large diff, intentionally isolated
from future feature work. Artwork closure tests inspect actual `data:image/`
payloads rather than formatting-dependent esbuild source comments.

| Artifact | Before raw / gzip B | After raw / gzip B |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Root reachable closure | 3,261,439 / 1,975,779 | 3,097,019 / 1,953,833 |
| Financial reachable closure | 2,657,131 / 1,835,894 | 2,643,361 / 1,833,618 |

Root raw headroom increases from **561 B** to **164,981 B** under the unchanged
3,262,000 B cap. This funds bounded follow-up work, not unlimited additions.
Consumer export parity, representative function names, source maps, utility
tree-shaking, native Node SSR and packed asset hashes remain checked. Package
packed/unpacked measurements include this documentation and are reported by
`npm run check:bundle`; no generated files are excluded from its inventory.

## Opt-in core client entry (issue #59)

`owncoding-ui/core` exports the 54 nonfinancial components/helpers currently
consumed by Scale plus `Button`, directly from their canonical modules. Root and
core are built in the same splitting graph, preserving strict export identity.
Its complete emitted closure (all 55 exports retained, without tree shaking)
measures 146,912 B raw / 42,933 B gzip, with a finite 150,000 / 44,000 B cap.
The closure and packed-package smoke tests reject inline image bytes. This is
an opt-in client boundary suitable for Next, where importing the compatible
root barrel can retain all of its client references, including bank artwork.
Root and financial exports, synchronous logos and asset catalogues stay intact;
no package-wide budgets are increased. Import the existing shared stylesheet as
before. Core does not export financial objects; use `owncoding-ui/financial`
where logos or bank selectors are required. No API is copied or replaced.
